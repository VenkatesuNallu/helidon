# Helidon Stream Readers and Writers Support Proposal

Provide an API that adds reading and writing support for a stream of objects. Evaluate the
posibility of building multipart support on top of these readers and writers.

## Proposal

Applications can extend Helidon SE by providing their own  readers and writers. In essence, 
a reader is a mapping of the form
`Publisher<DataChunk> -> T` and a writer is a mapping of the form `T -> Publisher<DataChunk>`. 
This notion can be extended to support object streams by defining a stream reader as 
`Publisher<DataChunk> -> Publisher<T>` and a stream writer as `Publisher<T> -> Publisher<DataChunk>`.

The way a stream of objects is parsed or serialized depends on the media type associated with
the request or response. For example, in a response of type `application/json`, a stream of
objects can be serialized as an array; in a response of type `application/stream+json` using
an object/record separator. The use of streaming types such as `application/stream+json` may
have some additional benefits for clients that support streaming.

Using stream readers and writers enables application code to receiver or provide `Publisher<T>`'s
directly without the need to serialize the stream into data chunks. Moreover, a low-level multipart API
can be built on top of these stream readers and writers simply by adding new types such as
`FormParam` and consuming or returning `Publisher<FormParam>`.

## Example 

An application returns a stream of JSON objects and uses `application/json` as media type.
It registers a stream writer and provides a `Publisher<JsonObject>` as follows:

```java
// Register stream writer -- should be moved to JsonSupport
response.registerStreamWriter(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON,
                              new JsonArrayStreamWriter<>(request, response, JsonObject.class));

// Create JSON object
JsonObject msg = JSON.createObjectBuilder()
                     .add("message", "This is a message")
                     .build();

// Produce response as stream of objects
response.send(subscriber -> subscriber.onSubscribe(
        new Flow.Subscription() {
            @Override
            public void request(long n) {
                for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                    subscriber.onNext(msg);
                }
                subscriber.onComplete();
            }

            @Override
            public void cancel() {
            }));
```

The class `JsonArrayStreamWriter` interjects data chunks for `[` , `,` and `]` as JSON array
delimiters and uses an existing JSON writer to serialize each JSON object.

Similarly, an application can read a stream of JSON objects by subscribing to a
`Publisher<JsonObject>` returned by Helidon as follows:

```java
request.content()
       .asPublisherOf(JsonObject.class)
       .subscribe(new Flow.Subscriber<JsonObject>() {
            @Override
            public void onSubscribe(Flow.Subscription subscription) {
                // ...
            }

            @Override
            public void onNext(JsonObject item) {
                // ...
            }

            @Override
            public void onError(Throwable throwable) {
                // ...
            }

            @Override
            public void onComplete() {
                // ...
            }
        });
```

## Multipart Support

Streaming readers and writers could be implemented to support the media types `multipart/form-data`
and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. Given,

```java
public class FormParam<T> {

    private String name;
    private T value;

    public FormParam(String name, T value) {
        this.name = name;
        this.value = value;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public T getValue() {
        return value;
    }
}
```

We need to use `GenericType<T>` to ensure that type information is available to the Helidon
runtime as follows:

```java
request.content()
       .asPublisherOf(new GenericType<FormParam<String>>(){})
       .subscribe(new Flow.Subscriber<FormParam<String>>() {
           @Override
           public void onSubscribe(Flow.Subscription subscription) {
           }

           @Override
           public void onNext(FormParam<String> item) {
           }

           @Override
           public void onError(Throwable throwable) {
           }

           @Override
           public void onComplete() {
           }
       });
```

Note that this represents a low-level API to process forms. A higher-level API should be
available to collect all params and provide them as a single `Form` object to the 
application. For example,

```java
request.content().as(Form.class).thenAccept(form -> ... );
```
